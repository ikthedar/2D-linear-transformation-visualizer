# 2D Linear Transformation Visualizer

## Overview

The **2D Linear Transformation Visualizer** is an interactive Python program that demonstrates how 2D matrices transform vectors and shapes. This project helps users understand the geometric effects of linear transformations, such as scaling, rotation, and shearing, by visualizing their impact on a unit square grid or vector.
